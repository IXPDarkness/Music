Rap battle! Seong Gi-Hun!;==?==;
Versus mrBeast!;==?==;
Begin!;==?==;
Welcome to your final test, I'm Mr beast;==?==;
We can scrap the 'S';==?==;
Cuz I've never missed a beat;==?==;
You had to cut from honey under;==?==;
Threat of a gun blastv;==?==;
When I had a cut from Honey;==?==;
That's another check that I'm gonna cash;==?==;
You're coming last, Number 1 is Jimmy!;==?==;
Only dub you have is horribly written;==?==;
You're accomplished 'cuz you fought the;==?==;
Opposition and became the best;==?==;
But the consequences that you've got;==?==;
To live with is;==?==;
You paved their deaths all to pay your debt;==?==;
I applaud you, Gi Hun;==?==;
In the diss game you won't get rich;==?==;
I'm like your momma: I'm dead sick;==?==;
Then check the gaming channel;==?==;
Millions of children watch it;==?==;
How'd you win all that Won, kid;==?==;
But not custody of one kid?;==?==;
Did ya think you'd get her back;==?==;
With that lighter you bought her?;==?==;
You're playing tug-o-war with your ex;==?==;
But the rope is your daughter;==?==;
So stupid, Sang Woo showed you the light;==?==;
You didn't go to SNU, that's right;==?==;
If the task was last to;==?==;
Get backstabbed by a pal;==?==;
You wouldn't make it through the night;==?==;
When I feast, I don't need a suit and tie;==?==;
Wrapping with gold like the food I try;==?==;
Utter a word, then you will die;==?==;
Save those subs for PewDiePie;==?==;
So this is the next test they'll;==?==;
Make us fight in our survival?;==?==;
But instead of a kiddie game;==?==;
We'll be playing this manchild? (Hm?);==?==;
Your career's fragile like glass;==?==;
I will smash it if you push me;==?==;
Made your fortune from subscribers;==?==;
Now give them their fucking cookies!;==?==;
You've done all this good;==?==;
You fed lives in need right;==?==;
'Till they get by each time;==?==;
Gave islands, sweet rides;==?==;
Let high trees thrive;==?==;
Set headlines being nice when;==?==;
You spread vibes;==?==;
Teens hype it and then buy MrBeast line;==?==;
So you make ten times what you leave guys;==?==;
Only ever "moving" when you're in set sight;==?==;
Of a keen child, like an anti red light;==?==;
Green light;==?==;
Don't talk about loyalty, you don't get any;==?==;
You're like "I Spent At Least;==?==;
Ten Thousand Dollars Renting People;==?==;
Out To Pretend To Be Friends With Me";==?==;
I wondered why VIPs had to;==?==;
Hide their face behind plastic;==?==;
Now that I see this bastard;==?==;
I get what the point of the mask is;==?==;
I just replaced all of Gi-Hun's;==?==;
Surviving friends with Legos!;==?==;
Um Jimmy, there aren't any Legos;==?==;
For a 'critique on greed', it seems ironic;==?==;
Your show sold out like;==?==;
It's stock from shopmrbeastcom, bitch;==?==;
You spent 24 hours in a bunker;==?==;
Another 24 inside of a fake prison;==?==;
And over 50 hours in a coffin could you do;==?==;
Us all a big solid and stay in it?;==?==;
Spending a minute with the Jeff;==?==;
Bezos for daycare kiddies;==?==;
Is a challenge that I couldn't;==?==;
Be paid to be in you can't make good lines;==?==;
I won't stay within them;==?==;
Like Jake the Viking, I'm straight up leaving;==?==;
Let's hope that you didn't bet all of;==?==;
Your money on winning this fight now;==?==;
'Cuz a lot like your job;==?==;
If that happened you're likely to die;==?==;
In my fire and strike out;==?==;
Join Team Seas and clean that garbage;==?==;
Past you deem so awful;==?==;
You lost everything to a pensioner;==?==;
Who lost his fucking marbles;==?==;
I make the calls in this torture ridden place;==?==;
You only got balls in an Orbeez giveaway;==?==;
It's a real manhunt;==?==;
You don't got the courage to beat me;==?==;
Go hide in your nerdy Dream Streams;==?==;
We've got more beef than your burger meat;==?==;
Beast plotting more seeds in your;==?==;
Girl than Team Trees;==?==;
Pictured a world where equality rules;==?==;
That's not just a pic you can fly to the moon;==?==;
Got no firepower against my roster;==?==;
Don't you "identify" as an attack helicopter;==?==;
You said hi to your brother;==?==;
With a brand new channel;==?==;
I said bye to my brother with a mag of ammo;==?==;
Go cry to your momma in an ad to pack dough;==?==;
You'd ditch your morals to put;==?==;
Your hand on Lambos;==?==;
Can't handle the truth if you;==?==;
Run out of money;==?==;
You run out of your personality too;==?==;
Out of 100% percent of your viewers;==?==;
Nobody watches your channel for you;==?==;
